# work-day-planner

**Description**

This is a daily planner created to give busy workers a way to manage their day.

**Installation**

Click on the settings tab.
Scroll down to the section that says GitHub Pages.
Click on the link in the green box next to "your site is published at".

Or you can just click here: https://dnfrancis22.github.io/work-day-planner/

**Usage**

When the page loads you see the header Work day scheduler. You can also see the current date.
Below the header you will see the time blocks. They are color coded depending on the hour. Green blocks represent the future. The red block represents the current hour. The grey blocks are the past. That's the part of the day that you don't have to worry about anymore.

You can enter notes into the blocks. Hit the save button and the notes will stay even if you refresh the page or close and reopen the browser.
